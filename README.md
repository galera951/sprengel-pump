# Sprengel Pump
## What is it?
This is my first physics project that I am doing with the help of the Department of General Physics at MIPT. Schemes and description you can find in relevant directories.

## TODO list (4 week) -> 0/4

- [ ] Assemble the setup
- [ ] Check the main parts for leaks
- [ ] Check the work with oil at height
- [ ] Write a theory and prepare a presentation

## TODO list (3 week) -> 4/4

- [x] Study to solder copper and brass with borax
- [x] Solder the oil supply system
- [x] Create a funnel
- [x] Find the pressure gauge

## TODO list (2 week) -> 3.5/4

- [x] Buy tubes with smaller diameters (< 3mm)
- VIT:
	- [x] Find fuses
	- [ ] Working/not working (again)
		- _Didn't have time to study_
- [x] Maximum tube size found
- [x] Buy copper tubes of the correct diameter

## TODO list (1 week) -> 1/4

- [x] VIT: working/not working
	- **Not working**
- [ ] Maximum tube size found
	- _Need to buy tubes with smaller diameters_
- [ ] We bought copper/brass adapters
	- _First must study the behavior of the oil in the silicone pipes_
- [ ] Started to learn how to solder "plumbing"
	- _First must study the behavior of the oil in the silicone pipes_

## Preparing for the presentation
- [ ] Drawing a scheme of setup in InkScape
